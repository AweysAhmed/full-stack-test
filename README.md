# Full Stack Coding Test

Please contain all the code required for your solution within this project. Be sure to keep the backend and frontend code seperate and use the structure provided. Afterwards, send the completed code back to us to review. Feel free to put comments in the HTML or Javascript to explain your solutions.


## Instructions

Your supervisor has instructed you to create the next Spotify. Your MVP requirements are only to create a browsable catalogue of available albums. The project is composed of two components:

### Back End

* Create a local ExpressJS server that serves
    * Static assets (HTML, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Web Fonts etc.)
    * JWT Authentication Tokens
    * Restful Album API (CRUD)
        * Write actions should only be allowed by authenticated users 

### Front End

* Create a music catalogue app which lists albums by
    * Title
    * Genre
    * Release Date
* Implement custom JWT based authentication
* Create an authenticated route thatâ€™s only accessible from a logged in user
* Logged in users should be able to perform write actions with the Album Rest API
    * UI should enable you create, update and delete



## Have Fun!

One thing to keep in mind here is that these are fairly open-ended for a reason. We want to see your creativity and style, there is plenty of room for finesse, so please feel free to use it. Also these things shouldn't take you longer than 6 - 12 hours, so please don't feel like you need to spend too long on it!

Have fun, show off, and please give us feedback so we can make this better!
